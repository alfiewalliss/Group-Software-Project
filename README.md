## DESCRIPTION OF GAME

The Snail Game is a test of both tactics and endurance, yet the aim of the game is relatively simple: complete as many tasks as possible and don't get caught by the snail!

On the map, there are three types of icons: player icons (showing yours and other player's locations), task icons (showing the locations of your specific tasks) and the snail icon (showing the location of the snail). This game uses your real-life location so, to complete a task, you must head to one of the task locations shown on the map.

When you start a new game, you will be greeted with the option to select what difficulty you would like to play the game at. There are 3 different abilities to pick between; easy, normal and hard. But, know that the harder you set the difficulty, the more points you get for completing a task! So your challenge is to collect as many points as you can before being caught by the dreaded snail! Do you have what it takes to defeat him? 🐌

## INSTALLATION GUIDE

To run the game locally, move into the 'techical doc' trajectory and first run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the software requirements then run 'python manage.py runserver' in terminal (make sure all migrations are done first via 'python manage.py makemigrations' 'python manage.py migrate').

## KNOWN BUGS AND FIXES

Currently there are no known bugs within the application. If you happen to stumble across one
please content us at admin@thesnailgame.com

## FAQ

-> Q. Can task locations be changed and/or new task locations introduced.
Yes! Those with access to game master account permissions are able to manipulate tasks.

-> Q. How can I give game master permissions to accounts?
By logging into an account with game master permissions and visiting the settings tabs, click on
'Adjust Game Master Accounts'. From here, add the name of the account you would like to give/take permissions from.

-> Q. How can I score more highly?
By visiting more locations and playing on a higher difficulty you will be able to increase your score dramatically!
